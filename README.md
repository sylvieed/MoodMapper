# Mood Mapper
This project was created during [DragonHacks 2023](https://dragonhacks-2023.devpost.com/).
It is a website that uses face-api.js to continuously track facial expressions in real time from the webcam. 
It uses this data in conjunction with website usage information from a chrome extension to visualize different kinds of data comparing mood to website usage.
The extension is [here](https://github.com/Ngmint923/MoodMapper-extension).
